- 🍪 Cookies not being set properly during login → found when working on logout functionality  
- ❌ Forgetting to store **user & token in localStorage** → caused issues with navbar login button  
- 🔗 Needed to create **API constants file** to avoid hardcoding and make future changes easier  
- 🐞 Debugging took extra time due to **lack of error boundaries** in some backend code  
- 🛤️ Wrong usage of **nested outlet routes** (e.g., `/dashboard` parent + `/dashboard/my-profile` child)  
- ⌨️ A single **spelling mistake in backend code** caused 30+ mins of debugging time 😅  
- ➕ Added **Resend OTP** feature after signup
