# PROBLEMS/DIFFICULTY THAT I HAVE FACED WHILE MAKING THIS APP 

* rendering user profile many times by useeffect hook
* hidden problem while login the cookies are not setting but i have written the code and i got to know when i am building logout button frontend to backend integration and removing token from cookies but it won't have tokne so the app fails to send response 
* i have not set the user and token to localstorage which is creating difficutly to render nav login button .
* creating data links for api and constants in seprate file so that in future we can change it will change every where

* i had done some internal code in backend which have no error boundary so it taken my precious time to debugging
* outlet routes handling in which  i have used wrong template like parent having /dashboard  route and i have given child also /dashboard/my-profile route which render profile of user 

* one spelling mistake at backend and i am frustated for 30min code is not working which can update profile
